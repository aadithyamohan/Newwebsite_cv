         <h1>AADITHYAMOHAN</h1>
         <p> <em>Software Engineer </em> - <strong>UST</strong></p>
         <p>I would like to differentiate myself as DAS.
           <b> Dependable, Approachable and Self-Assured Person</b>.
            And now a question may arise in your mind, like ' So, What' or maybe 'HOW'.
            I am a multitalented person and therefore I always make sure to use them all effectively. 
            I am a singer and a dancer, from which I have learned that hard work, discipline, perseverance and dedication are the key to success and 
            also the importance of team player. I am a yoga trainer, from which I have learned how to teach.
            I am a baker and an entrepreneur, my business name is 'Creamy Affair',from which I have learned that a small step makes a big difference,
            the importance of planning,execution and as well as Time management. I am an Actor and a model, from which I have learned the importance of presentation and execution and As suhail said : To be enthusiastic,act enthusiastic.
            And by profession, I am a Software Tester from which I learned the importance of Quality and with all these effective use of my talents, now I am able to 
            build a small fresher team and make them technically and mentally capable to actively perform in their respective fields.
            From all these I can say I am person who never let go and very passionate.(For example, I have a dance team in UST named, MOKSHA and 4 days before 
            Foundation day I met with an accident but I actually stood up for my team and make sure this doesn't affect my team.
            As a person, I am trying to make a difference in making a girl dependent on family concept. I want to actually give a different impression to society and 
            actually working for that, and in the course of doing it I am actually talking to many women come across my life and try to make understand that 'Life is not a 
            compromise', be independent and work for it.
            To conclude with, I would like to again mention that, Yes, I am DAS : Dependable,Approachable,and self assured person.
